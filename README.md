# weather app

## GOAL : I was asked to produce a web page displaying the weather conditions for 10 random users on a map.

+ The random (french) users will be generated by calls to the randomUser.me API. This API unfortunately gives wrong coordinates (there are not consistent with the city name...). So you will have to convert the city name into coordinates (geocode) with this geocoding API
+ The weather condition for a specific longitude / latitude  will be given by open-meteo.com API.
+ The weather conditions must be displayed on a map provided by the leaflet library, as a marker.
+ Every second, a new user is picked (and the weather condition of his location is displayed. Thus, you will create a growing list of markers. When this list reaches 10 elements, the first element is poped out as the last element is pushed in. Consequently, you will constantly have a list of 10 markers completly renewed every 10 seconds.
